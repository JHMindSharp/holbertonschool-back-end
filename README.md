# API Amateur Project

## Introduction
This project, authored by Sylvain Kalache and facilitated by Holberton School, involves utilizing APIs to access and manipulate employee data. This task highlights the shift from traditional Bash scripting to more versatile languages like Python, particularly for system administrators and SREs.

## Background Context
Traditionally, system administrators relied heavily on Bash for scripting. However, for more complex or messy tasks, modern scripting in Python offers efficiency and manageability. This project demonstrates using Python scripts to interact with APIs, moving beyond the limitations of Bash scripting.

## Resources
- Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script
- Understanding APIs:
  - [What is an API?](#)
  - [What is a REST API?](#)
  - [Microservices](#)
- Code style:
  - [PEP8 Python Style Guide](#)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, participants should be able to explain:
- Limitations of Bash scripting
- Basics of APIs and REST APIs
- Concept of microservices
- Data formats: CSV and JSON
- Pythonic naming conventions

## Requirements
- **Environment:** Scripts will be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.x.
- **Coding Style:** All Python files must adhere to PEP8 style guidelines.
- **Documentation:** Each module must include comprehensive documentation.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Gather Data from an API
Write a Python script to fetch and display progress on an employee's TODO list using their ID.

### Task 1: Export to CSV
Extend the Python script from Task 0 to export TODO list data to a CSV file.

### Task 2: Export to JSON
Modify the Python script to export TODO list data in JSON format.

### Task 3: Dictionary of List of Dictionaries
Further extend the Python script to compile TODO list data from all employees into a comprehensive JSON file.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the scripts locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JHMindSharp/holbertonschool-back-end
cd api
./<script_name>.py 
```
